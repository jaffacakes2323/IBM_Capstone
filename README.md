# IBM_Capstone

This repository holds the Jupyter Notebook files for the IBM final projet (Project 2 in portfolio)

This project is more geared towards showing knowledge of tools (Python & SQL) used for data analysis

Libraries included:
* Pandas
* Beautiful Soup
* JSON
* Requests
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

Week 1 - This file has 3 notebooks for import data from APIs, web pages, and starts some exploratory analysis:
(1) API folder:
- Jobs_API.ipynb (the Flask file used to host API, created by course providers. Everything that follows is my code and work)
- Collecting_Jobs_data_Using_API.ipynb (first assignment for pulling data from API)
- job-postings.xlsx (Excel file created in assignment, after pulling data and sorting into dataframe)

(2) Web scraping folder:
- Web-Scraping-Lab.ipynb (main file for scraping data from website)
- popular-languages.csv (CSV file created after scraping data)

(3) Exploring data folder: 
- M1ExploreDataSet-lab.ipynb (main file for exploration)

Week 2 - This week is for data wrangling (finding, determining, removing duplicates & missing values. Plus normalising data)
- DataWranglingNotebook.ipynb

Week 3 - Further explatory data analysis (plotting distribution, finding outliers and checking for correlation)
- ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb

Week 4 - Data visualisation (Visualising distribution, relationship, composition and comparision)
- DataVisualisation.ipynb (main folder for assignment)
- m4_survey_data.sqlite (data used for exploring)

Week 5 - Using IBM Cognos Analytics to create a dashboard (Screenshots included here, as link maybe inactive)
- - IBM Cloud Pak for data (HTTP link for dashboard)
- survery_data_demographics.csv (data used for dashboard)
- survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv (data used for dashboard)
